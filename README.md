This repository is the greater PantryTracker food storage management system.


The intent of this is:

1) For end users to track what is in their pantry
2) Receive notifications when running low on commonly-consume products
3) Provide recipe ideas and low-cost grocery runs by using what is in their pantry
4) Easily update their pantry by wiring up to their online grocery accounts
        * Potentials for wiring up:
            a) Amazon Prime Pantry
            b) Walmart Grocery Pickup & Order History
            c) Kroger Click-List
