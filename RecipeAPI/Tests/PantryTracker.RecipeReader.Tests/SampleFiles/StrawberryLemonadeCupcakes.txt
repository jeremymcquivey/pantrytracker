strawberry lemonade cupcakes
3 cups flour
1 Tbsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
2 cups sugar
4 eggs
3 Tbsp. lemon zest (from 2 lemons)
1/2 cup thawed lemonade concentrate
1 cup buttermilk
Directions
Preheat oven to 325*. Prepare muffin tins with paper liners.
Whisk flour, baking powder and salt together and set aside. Cream butter and sugar on high until pale, light and fluffy (about 5 minutes). Add eggs one at a time, mixing thoroughly before adding the next one. Add lemon zest and lemonade. Turn mixer to low. Add the dry ingredients in three batches, alternating with the buttermilk in two batches. Mix only until just incorporated.
Fill each muffin cup 3/4 full. Bake for 25 minutes or until a skewer shows only moist crumbs attached, rotating the pans at the halfway point. Allow cupcakes to cool completely in the pans before removing.
