Course: Dinner
Author: The Gunny Sack

1 1/2 lbs boneless skinless, chicken breasts
2 tbsp vegetable oil for frying
Sesame seeds & sliced green onions for garnish if desired
Marinade:
1/4 cup. Soy sauce
1/4 cup cornstarch
2 tbsp water
Orange Sauce:
1 tbsp vegetable oil
3/4 cup. Pulp free orange juice concentrate thawed (or for a lighter orange flavor use prepared orange juice)
3 tbsp: barbecue sauce used Sweet Baby Rays

1. Start by cutting 1 1/2 pounds of chicken breasts into chunks (about 1 - 1 1/2 cubes). Mix together soy sauce, cornstarch, and water. Add the chicken and stir to coat. Allow the chicken to marinate for 5 minutes.
2. While it is marinating, prepare the orange sauce so that it is ready when you need it later. Mix together oil, pulp-free orange juice concentrate (or use prepared orange juice for lighter flavor) and barbecue sauce.
3. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Remove the chicken from the marinade with a slotted spoon and carefully add it to the skillet. Stir-fry the chicken, over medium-high heat, for 5-7 minutes until golden and cooked through.
4. Add the orange sauce to the chicken and cook for 4-6 minutes, stirring constantly until the sauce has thickened.
5. Top with sesame seeds and sliced green onions, if desired. Serve over rice or noodles.
